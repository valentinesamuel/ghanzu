## Project Purpose
This project was made to test my knowledge on the basic structure and functionality of a website built with Angular in html and css and TS. It serves as my first full length project started from scratch in angular. Since this project was a test of my knowledge, i used as little help resources as i could with the exception of debugging some css features such as the broken navbar, and assistance with flexbox. 

This allowed me to see where my strengths where and which sections i meeded to work on.

## Basic Structure
1. Home Page



The home page contains the basic details of the company. These include:
 * Achievements
 * Services offered
 * About us
 * Testimonials
 * Attorneys
 * Appointment Booking
 * Footer


## Additional Challenges

Managing development and publishing is not an easy task.

## Final thoughts

From this project, i have learnt that no website or application has an ending. It needs constant maintenance.
