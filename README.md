## Project Purpose
This project was made to test my knowledge on the basic structure and functionality of a website built with angular in html and css and TS. It serves as my first full length project started from scratch in angular. Since this project was a test of my knowledge, i used as little help resources as i could with the exception of debugging some css features such as the broken navbar, and assistance with flexbox. 

This allowed me to see where my strengths where and which sections i meeded to work on.

Styling the forms has been very difficult because i had recently started learning flex.

## Final thoughts
