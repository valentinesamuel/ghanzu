## Project Purpose
This project was made to test my knowledge on the basic structure and functionality of a website built with angular in html and css and TS. It serves as my first full length project started from scratch in angular. Since this project was a test of my knowledge, i used as little help resources as i could with the exception of debugging some css features such as the broken navbar, and assistance with flexbox. 

This allowed me to see where my strengths where and which sections i meeded to work on.

## Basic Structure
1. Home Page
2. User-Card Page


The home page contains the basic details of the company. These include:
 * The Github username of the user
 * The search field


The user-card page contains the information about the queried username. These include:
 * The username 
 * The location
 * The repositories
 * The hireable status
 * The profile picture

## Additional Challenges

Manipulating the DOM with javascript is a bit tedious work.

## Final thoughts

This project was not easy but i am determined to finish this project.
