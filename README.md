## Project Purpose
This project was made to test my knowledge on the basic structure and functionality of a website built with Angular in html and css and TS. It serves as my first full length project started from scratch in angular. I have also integrated firebase in place of BaaS. With firebase's realtime database, i was able to use the API to send the client's booking data to the database.

## Additional Challenges

Managing development and publishing is not an easy task.

## Final thoughts

From this project, i have learnt that no website or application has an ending. It needs constant maintenance.
